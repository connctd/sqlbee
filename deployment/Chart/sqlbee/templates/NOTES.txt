Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}. If you are using the default `namespaceSelector`
as provided by this chart, then you probably want to label all namespaces where sqlbee should
inject cloudSQL proxy sidecars into your pods. This can be done for example like this
```
kubectl label namespace default sqlbee-sidecar-injector=enabled
```
For the default namespace. Additionally you probably now want to add annotations like
`sqlbee.connctd.io.inject: true` to your pod specs.

Have an excellent day!
